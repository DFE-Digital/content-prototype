Many UK children are not currently attending school due to measures put in place to prevent the spread of Coronavirus. Information, guidance and support is available for parents and carers of children who are learning at home.

@This page will be updated regularly to include further resources and reflect the latest information and developments.@

## Information, guidance and support for parents and carers of children who are learning at home

[Schools, nurseries and childcare providers are currently closed](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/closure-of-educational-settings-information-for-parents-and-carers/closure-of-educational-settings-information-for-parents-and-carers#closures-of-schools-childcare-and-other-educational-settings) to the majority of children. Places are available for [vulnerable children](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/closure-of-educational-settings-information-for-parents-and-carers/closure-of-educational-settings-information-for-parents-and-carers#vulnerable-children) and the children of [critical workers](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/closure-of-educational-settings-information-for-parents-and-carers/closure-of-educational-settings-information-for-parents-and-carers#critical-workers).

While staying at home due to coronavirus (social distancing), parents and carers may be worried about their children's development and the impact of missing school or nursery.

No one expects parents to act as teachers, or to provide the activities and feedback that a school or nursery would. Parents and carers should do their best to help children and support their learning while dealing with competing demands.

Parents of secondary school children should contact their school for guidance. Additional advice will be available for these parents soon.

Educational programmes to help children learn at home are available on the BBC.

## Mental health and wellbeing

The change of routine and staying at home may make this a difficult time for some children. Public Health England has published advice on how to [support your children's wellbeing](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-guidance-on-supporting-children-and-young-peoples-mental-health-and-wellbeing) during the coronavirus outbreak.
