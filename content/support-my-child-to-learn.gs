##Overview

While staying at home because of coronavirus (social distancing), parents and carers may be worried about children not going to nursery or their usual childcare provider.

You may be concerned about their development or finding the best things to do with them throughout the day.

No one expects parents to act as teachers or childcare providers. Or to be able to provide all the activities that a nursery might.

While children can gain a lot from nursery, research shows that the things parents do at home help their development more. There are lots of simple, everyday things you can do at home to help their learning and development.

See [the best ways to help your child learn at home](/support-my-child-to-learn/the-best-ways-to-help-your-child-learn-at-home/).

###How long you will have to keep your child at home

Nurseries and childcare providers will be closed to the majority of children until further notice. However, by following the governmentâ€™s advice and staying at home, you are doing your part to help resolve things sooner.

###Who can still send their child to nursery

Some nurseries and childcare providers will stay open for the children of critical workers, such as people who work in the NHS.

[See the guidance on childcare closures](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/closure-of-educational-settings-information-for-parents-and-carers/closure-of-educational-settings-information-for-parents-and-carers#closures-of-schools-childcare-and-other-educational-settings) which includes advice for critical workers.
