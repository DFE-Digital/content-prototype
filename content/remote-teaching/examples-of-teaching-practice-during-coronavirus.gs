^This guidance was last updated to include new information on curriculum planning for a phased return to schools.^

{:.call-to-action}
Read the latest [guidance for nurseries, schools and colleges](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/coronavirus-covid-19-guidance-for-schools-and-other-educational-settings), including information on opening to more pupils from 1 June.

An opportunity for schools to learn from each other's emerging practice as they develop their approaches to teaching in both school and home settings.

The Department for Education (DfE) is working with schools during the coronavirus outbreak to develop this guidance. It outlines some approaches that have worked for schools, as well as their plans for a phased return to school sites, including case studies and information about:

## Planning a curriculum to teach at school and at home

* [Deciding what to teach during a phased return](/remote-teaching/planning-a-curriculum-to-teach-at-school-and-at-home/deciding-what-to-teach-during-a-phased-return/)

* [Supporting staff in curriculum planning for a phased return](/remote-teaching/planning-a-curriculum-to-teach-at-school-and-at-home/supporting-staff-in-curriculum-planning-for-a-phased-return/)

* [Pastoral care in the curriculum ](/remote-teaching/planning-a-curriculum-to-teach-at-school-and-at-home/pastoral-care-in-the-curriculum/)

* [Identifying and addressing gaps in pupils’ understanding](/remote-teaching/planning-a-curriculum-to-teach-at-school-and-at-home/identifying-and-addressing-gaps-in-pupils-understanding/)

The schools that have helped with this guidance are developing their practice in a variety of different circumstances.

School leaders have explained that providing education remotely will be different for every school, and that the approaches taken will depend on each school’s unique circumstances and challenges. This includes considering the age of pupils. Learning at home for younger children will typically need more involvement from parents, and parents are facing a range of pressures at this time.

## Technology support for children and schools

Most of the examples given in this guidance are from schools that already had some infrastructure or technology in place. Many schools and households do not have the same level of access, so we’re developing examples of effective practice from schools in these circumstances, and for schools providing education to younger children.

Local authorities, academy trusts and schools can [get help with technology for remote education during coronavirus](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/get-help-with-technology-for-remote-education-during-coronavirus-covid-19), including information on how to get internet access, digital devices and support to provide remote education.
