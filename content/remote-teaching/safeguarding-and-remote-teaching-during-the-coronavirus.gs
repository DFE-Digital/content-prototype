## Safeguarding teachers and pupils online

Most children are being educated remotely during the coronavirus outbreak, so school leaders and teachers are having to adjust to remote learning strategies. While this is happening, it is important that schools continue to follow safeguarding procedures.

As set out in the [coronavirus: safeguarding in schools, colleges and other providers guidance,](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-safeguarding-in-schools-colleges-and-other-providers/coronavirus-covid-19-safeguarding-in-schools-colleges-and-other-providers#child-protection-policy)
online teaching should follow the same principles set out in your school’s staff behaviour policy (sometimes known as a code of conduct).

### Helping teachers stay safe online

Keeping teachers safe when providing remote teaching is essential. Remote education is a new experience for both staff and pupils, so it’s important that schools understand how to approach safeguarding procedures online.

### Communicating safely with parents, carers and pupils

The most common form of remote communication between schools, parents and carers
and pupils is usually a learning platform (for example, Google or Office 365).

When communicating online with parents and pupils, schools should consider:

* communicating within school hours as much as possible (or hours agreed with the school to suit teachers' needs and wellbeing)
* only communicating through the school channels approved by the senior leadership team (not social media accounts like Facebook)
* only using school-registered email accounts (not personal ones)
* only using school devices, not personal equipment (although it’s understandable that this isn’t always possible)

Schools may wish to use these resources to understand more about teaching safely online:

* remote learning advice from [The Key for School Leaders](https://schoolleaders.thekeysupport.com/covid-19/safeguard-and-support-pupils/safeguarding-while-teaching/remote-teaching-safeguarding-pupils-and-staff/?marker=content-body)
* advice from [NSPCC](https://learning.nspcc.org.uk/news/2020/march/undertaking-remote-teaching-safely) on undertaking remote education safely
* guidance from the [UK Safer Internet Centre](https://swgfl.org.uk/resources/safe-remote-learning/) on remote learning

### Virtual lessons and live streaming

There is no expectation that teachers should live stream or provide pre-recorded videos. Schools should consider the approaches that best suit the needs of pupils and staff.

However, if your school decides to teach virtual lessons it’s important to follow  best-practice guidelines to ensure online safety.

Teaching from home is different to teaching in the classroom. Teachers should try to find a quiet or private room or area to talk to pupils, parents or carers. When broadcasting a lesson or making a recording, consider what will be in the background.

In some areas schools may also be able to seek support from their local authority when planning online lessons and activities and considering online safety.

### Pastoral care

Schools might want to consider whether one-to-one sessions could be appropriate in some circumstances. For example, to provide pastoral care or provide support for SEN/D pupils.

But this should be discussed and approved by the senior leadership team to assess any risks. There may be helpful solutions, such as including a parent or additional staff member in the call.

Helping parents and pupils to make a weekly plan or structure that includes time for learning, playing and relaxing is important to reduce stress and anxiety.

As set out in [Public Health England’s guidance for parents and carers](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-guidance-on-supporting-children-and-young-peoples-mental-health-and-wellbeing/guidance-for-parents-and-carers-on-supporting-children-and-young-peoples-mental-health-and-wellbeing-during-the-coronavirus-covid-19-outbreak#helping-children-and-young-people-cope-with-stress), routine can give children and young people an increased feeling of safety in the context of uncertainty.

### Helping pupils stay safe online

The [Teaching online safety](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/teaching-online-safety-in-schools) in schools guidance provides information to help schools ensure their pupils understand how to stay safe and behave online.

School contact with parents and carers during this time can also be used to reinforce the importance of children being safe.

It's especially important for parents and carers to be aware of what their children are being asked to do, including:

* sites they will be asked to use
* school members their child will interact with

Schools should emphasise the importance of a safe online environment and encourage parents and carers to consider internet filters to block malicious websites and age appropriate parental controls on digital devices. These are usually free, but often need to be turned on.

### Personal data and GDPR

Schools and colleges should continue to follow GDPR when managing personal data and may need to consider:

* taking care not to share contact details when emailing multiple people
* sharing of usernames and other personal data for access; it’s best practice to use school-provided email addresses
* providing access to schools data systems safely

### Reporting concerns

It is essential to have and communicate clear reporting routes so that children, teachers, parents and carers can raise any concerns.

Schools may wish to review the existing arrangements to ensure they are appropriate for remote learning and teaching, or if additional or alternative arrangements need to be put in place.

Consider signposting to practical support for:

#### Harmful or upsetting content

* reporting harmful online content to [UK Safer Internet Centre](https://www.saferinternet.org.uk/advice-centre/parents-and-carers)
