##Reception, year 1 and year 2 children

The best way to help these children learn is to:

* sit with them as they work
* do active, practical things, rather than trying to make them sit and listen for long periods
* try to break down the work into easier chunks
* take frequent breaks
* reward them when they do well

###Phonics

You may already know about phonics, it is a way of teaching children to read quickly and skilfully.

Contact your school to see how they have been teaching this. Sit with your child and practice with them, following the advice from school.

See more advice about [reading together](/parents/help-primary-school-chidren-learn-at-home/reading-together/index.html#reading-together).

###Counting

Practice counting and numbers. This does not have to be something planned. Count things around the house while you are doing other things.

###Talking

Talk with your child throughout the day, try to practice new words they have learned at school.
