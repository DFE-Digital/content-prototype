##Structuring the day

Do not worry about trying to keep to the full routine that your child had at school. But, children will feel more comfortable and learn better with a predictable routine to the day, even if this is difficult.

When school provides children with work they may give you advice on how to structure the day. But generally you should try to make sure that they:

* get up and go to bed at the same time each day
* have regular meal times
* have regular breaks
* make time to be active, children are used to regular play at lunch and break times
