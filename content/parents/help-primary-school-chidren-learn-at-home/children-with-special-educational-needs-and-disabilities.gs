##Children with special educational needs and disabilities (SEND)

We know that staying at home can be more disruptive to the lives and routines of children with special educational needs and disabilities.

Your childâ€™s school is still responsible for providing them with work and giving them feedback, so contact them if you are not in contact already.

We are working with other organisations to create extra resources to help you. Visit:
