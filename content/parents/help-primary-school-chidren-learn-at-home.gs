##Overview

While staying at home because of coronavirus (social distancing), parents and carers may be worried about children not going to school.

No one expects parents to act as teachers. Or to be able to set work and give feedback as a school would. Contact your child’s school. It’s still their responsibility to set work and give that feedback.

However, we are asking parents to do their best to help children with this work and support their learning.

Alongside work children receive from school we have a [list of online educational resources](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-online-education-resources/coronavirus-covid-19-list-of-online-education-resources-for-home-education) for you to try.

There is separate [advice for early years children](/parents/support-my-child-to-learn/). Parents of secondary school children should contact their school. However, we will be supplying new advice for these parents soon.

###How long you will have to keep your child at home

Primary schools are currently closed to the majority of children, however we are reviewing the situation regularly. By following the government’s advice and staying at home, you are doing your part to help resolve things sooner.

###Who can still send their child to school

Some primary schools will stay open for vulnerable children and the children of certain key workers, such as people who work in the NHS.

[See the guidance on school closures](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/closure-of-educational-settings-information-for-parents-and-carers/closure-of-educational-settings-information-for-parents-and-carers#closures-of-schools-childcare-and-other-educational-settings) which includes advice for key workers.

###Free school meals

Children who receive free school meals are still entitled to them. See our [advice on free school meals](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/closure-of-educational-settings-information-for-parents-and-carers/closure-of-educational-settings-information-for-parents-and-carers#free-school-meals).

###Mental health and wellbeing

This can be a difficult time for children. See our [advice on supporting children’s mental health and wellbeing](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-guidance-on-supporting-children-and-young-peoples-mental-health-and-wellbeing).

It’s also important to take care of yourself, see our [advice on mental health and wellbeing](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-guidance-for-the-public-on-mental-health-and-wellbeing).
