Many UK children are not currently attending school due to measures put in place to prevent the spread of Coronavirus. Information, guidance and support is available for parents and carers of children who are learning at home.

## Information, guidance and support for parents and carers of children who are learning at home

While staying at home due to coronavirus (social distancing), parents and carers may be worried about their children's development and the impact of missing school or nursery.

No one expects parents to act as teachers, or to provide the activities and feedback that a school or nursery would. Parents and carers should do their best to help children and support their learning while dealing with competing demands.

Some schools and pre-schools will stay open for vulnerable children and the [children of certain key workers](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/closure-of-educational-settings-information-for-parents-and-carers/closure-of-educational-settings-information-for-parents-and-carers#closures-of-schools-childcare-and-other-educational-settings), such as parents who work in the NHS.
