## By teachers, for teachers: how the curriculum map was developed

The map was developed by Oak National Academy in consultation with:

* the education sector
* teachers
* senior leaders 
* subject bodies

Oak led on delivery, collaborating with representative bodies, together with curriculum and subject experts across the sector. Oak has worked to ensure this map is high-quality, sequenced, accessible and adaptable for all schools.

## Plans to produce future resources aligned to the curriculum map

DfE is working with Oak, BBC Bitesize and others to ensure that the curriculum map will be accompanied by high quality, time-saving lesson resources. Many of these resources will be available before the start of the 2020 autumn term.

You will be able to use the map and resources in a number of ways:

* as a flexible tool that gives you access to lesson resources and teaching materials that are suitable for use both in-class and online

* as a guide or model to support curriculum planning

* by adopting the entire sequence of the map across subjects, year groups or key stages
