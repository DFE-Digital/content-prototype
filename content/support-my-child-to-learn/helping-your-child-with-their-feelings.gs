##Helping your child with their feelings

Your child may be feeling worried and frustrated at this time too. Listen carefully if they want to talk about their feelings. Let them know itâ€™s okay to be worried but reassure them that you are there to keep them safe, and you are doing everything you can. Talking about their feelings will help their development too.

Try to protect them from frightening news broadcasts.
